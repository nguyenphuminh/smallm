# smallm

Smallm (smaLL + LLm) is my attempt on making a tiny toy language model just for fun and educational purposes. It has about 28m parameters and is trained on 300k samples of the Cosmopedia dataset which have roughly 325m tokens. This is very small compared to LLMs' standards, which also explains why it is kinda goofy when you use it (lol), but you can definitely train this on a mid-range card for just half a day or 1-2 days, and it can still generate proper English and data that should be related to the user's prompt.

## Setup

Setup venv and install necessary packages:

```sh
# Create and activate venv (run this every time you start)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# or "./venv/bin/activate" if you are on windows

# Install packages (once)
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install tiktoken datasets
```

Of course, you should already install compatible CUDA and Python versions, I currently use Python 3.13 and CUDA 13 (which is compatible with CUDA 12.8 mentioned above).

## Running smallm

1. Download the latest model (`chatbot.pth`) in the releases page.
2. Simply run:
```sh
python main.py
```

A prompt will appear for you to chat with the model. You can also import the `ChatBot` class for more control if needed.

## Training

Head over to `./main.py` and change `training` to `True`, then run:
```sh
python main.py
```

The model will train for 10 epochs (estimated 18-20 hours on my Laptop RTX 5070), and after each epoch it will save the current model to `./chatbot.pth`. Note that the version in the releases page is only trained for 5 epochs.

To start from where you left off, just name your file `chatbot_continue.pth` to resume training.

## Architecture

Currently it uses:

* Tokenizer: Tiktoken with GPT-2 encoding (50,257 vocab size)
* Embedding: 256-dimensional token embeddings
* Positional Encoding: Sinusoidal positional encoding
* Transformer: 3 encoder layers, 8 attention heads, 256 hidden size
* Output: Linear layer to vocabulary

and is trained with:

* Dataset: Cosmopedia (~325M tokens)
* Context Window: 1024 tokens
* Batch Size: 8 (effective batch size: 64 with gradient accumulation)
* Optimizer: AdamW with mixed precision training
* 5 epochs (about 9 hours on the laptop-version RTX 5070)

and generates text with:

* Sampling: Top-k sampling (k=50)
* Temperature: 0.8 (configurable)
* Context Window: 1024 tokens
* Stopping: Natural EOS token or conversation breaks
* Simple repetition penalty
